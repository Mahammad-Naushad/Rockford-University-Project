            Rockford University is investing $1.2 million in improvements to its campus, with the majority of work taking place during the summer months and prior to the University’s first day of classes on August 22, 2018. Approved by the Board of Trustees at its May meeting, the scope of work will impact virtually every area of campus. Approximately $600,000 of the $1.2 million has been dedicated to residence hall improvements.
            Since 2008, the University has invested $25 million and made substantial improvements to its physical plant, including the 2015 renovations to the Burpee Student Center and Seaver Physical Education Center that totaled more than $5 million, and the recently completed $1 million modernization of the Starr Science Center. This summer’s project plan will focus on those elements that have the greatest impact to the overall student experience.
            Senior Director of Operations Ed Tomaszkiewicz notes that just as important to the University’s external appearance is ensuring that critical infrastructure improvements are also part of the summer’s work schedule adding, “Balancing projects that include needs for new furniture, carpet, windows, exterior lighting and sidewalks with items like backup generators, chiller pumps, coils, and electrical system upgrades allow us to enjoy the excitement of sharing the visible transformations with our students and guests, while at the same time, giving us increased peace of mind that we are investing in what’s necessary to support the needs of a busy and growing campus.”
