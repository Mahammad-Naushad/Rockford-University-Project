        <p>The President’s Opening Convocation at Rockford University is an annual tradition dating back to 1851 and formally celebrates the start of the new academic year. The President’s Opening Convocation will be held on Friday, August 24, at 12 p.m., Maddox Theatre, located in the Clark Arts Center.
            The formal opening convocation includes an academic procession of faculty in traditional robes depicting their rank, with stoles representing their respective alma maters and degrees. Remarks will be given by President Eric W. Fulcomer, Ph.D. His address, “What’s Your Story?” will touch on how this particular time in the lives of 
                students has enormous potential to shape and change not only their personal story for the better, but also the stories of those in their communities and beyond.
